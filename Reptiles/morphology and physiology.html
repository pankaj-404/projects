        <div id="r2">  <h3>Circulation</h3>
            <p>All squamates and turtles have a three-chambered heart consisting of two atria, one variably partitioned
                ventricle, and two aortas that lead to the systemic circulation. The degree of mixing of oxygenated and
                deoxygenated blood in the three-chambered heart varies depending on the species and physiological state.
                Under different conditions, deoxygenated blood can be shunted back to the body or oxygenated blood can
                be shunted back to the lungs. This variation in blood flow has been hypothesized to allow more effective
                thermoregulation and longer diving times for aquatic species, but has not been shown to be a fitness
                advantage</p>
            <p>or example, Iguana hearts, like the majority of the squamates hearts, are composed of three chambers with
                two aorta and one ventricle, cardiac involuntary muscles.[70] The main structures of the heart are the
                sinus venosus, the pacemaker, the left atrium, the right atruim, the atrioventricular valve, the cavum
                venosum, cavum arteriosum, the cavum pulmonale, the muscular ridge, the ventricular ridge, pulmonary
                veins, and paired aortic arches.</p>
            <p>

                Some squamate species (e.g., pythons and monitor lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become
                functionally four-chambered hearts during contraction. This is made possible by a muscular ridge that
                subdivides the ventricle during ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular
                systole. Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure
                differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.[72]
            </p>
            <p>
                Crocodilians have an anatomically four-chambered heart, similar to birds, but also have two systemic
                aortas and are therefore capable of bypassing their pulmonary circulation.[73] </p>

            <h3>Metabolism</h3>
            <p>Modern non-avian reptiles exhibit some form of cold-bloodedness (i.e. some mix of poikilothermy,
                ectothermy, and bradymetabolism) so that they have limited physiological means of keeping the body
                temperature constant and often rely on external sources of heat. Due to a less stable core temperature
                than birds and mammals, reptilian biochemistry requires enzymes capable of maintaining efficiency over a
                greater range of temperatures than in the case for warm-blooded animals. The optimum body temperature
                range varies with species, but is typically below that of warm-blooded animals; for many lizards, it
                falls in the 24°–35 °C (75°–95 °F) range,[74] while extreme heat-adapted species, like the American
                desert iguana Dipsosaurus dorsalis, can have optimal physiological temperatures in the mammalian range,
                between 35° and 40 °C (95° and 104 °F).[75] While the optimum temperature is often encountered when the
                animal is active, the low basal metabolism makes body temperature drop rapidly when the animal is
                inactive.</p>

            As in all animals, reptilian muscle action produces heat. In large reptiles, like leatherback turtles,
            the low surface-to-volume ratio allows this metabolically produced heat to keep the animals warmer than
            their environment even though they do not have a warm-blooded metabolism.[76] This form of homeothermy
            is called gigantothermy; it has been suggested as having been common in large dinosaurs and other
            extinct large-bodied reptiles.</p>
            <p>
                The benefit of a low resting metabolism is that it requires far less fuel to sustain bodily functions.
                By using temperature variations in their surroundings, or by remaining cold when they do not need to
                move, reptiles can save considerable amounts of energy compared to endothermic animals of the same
                size.[79] A crocodile needs from a tenth to a fifth of the food necessary for a lion of the same weight
                and can live half a year without eating.[80] Lower food requirements and adaptive metabolisms allow
                reptiles to dominate the animal life in regions where net calorie availability is too low to sustain
                large-bodied mammals and birds.</p>
            <p>
                It is generally assumed that reptiles are unable to produce the sustained high energy output necessary
                for long distance chases or flying.[81] Higher energetic capacity might have been responsible for the
                evolution of warm-bloodedness in birds and mammals.[82] However, investigation of correlations between
                active capacity and thermophysiology show a weak relationship.[83] Most extant reptiles are carnivores
                with a sit-and-wait feeding strategy; whether reptiles are cold blooded due to their ecology is not
                clear. Energetic studies on some reptiles have shown active capacities equal to or greater than similar
                sized warm-blooded animals.</p>
            <h3>Respiratory system</h3>
            <p>
                All reptiles breathe using lungs. Aquatic turtles have developed more permeable skin, and some species
                have modified their cloaca to increase the area for gas exchange.[85] Even with these adaptations,
                breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs. Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in
                each main reptile group. In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial
                musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this
                constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, have
                found a way around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement
                to their normal "axial breathing". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense
                locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. Tegu lizards are known to possess a
                proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually
                capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off
                the lungs.Crocodilians actually have a muscular diaphragm that is analogous to the mammalian diaphragm.
                The difference is that the muscles for the crocodilian diaphragm pull the pubis (part of the pelvis,
                which is movable in crocodilians) back, which brings the liver down, thus freeing space for the lungs to
                expand. This type of diaphragmatic setup has been referred to as the "hepatic piston". The airways form
                a number of double tubular chambers within each lung. On inhalation and exhalation air moves through the
                airways in the same direction, thus creating a unidirectional airflow through the lungs. A similar
                system is found in birds,[87] monitor lizards[88] and iguanas.[89]
            </p>
            <p>
                Most reptiles lack a secondary palate, meaning that they must hold their breath while swallowing.
                Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate that allows them to continue breathing while remaining
                submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also
                have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended
                their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals
                to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.[90] </p>

            <h3>Turtles and tortoises</h3>
            <p>How turtles and tortoises breathe has been the subject of much study. To date, only a few species have
                been studied thoroughly enough to get an idea of how those turtles breathe. The varied results indicate
                that turtles and tortoises have found a variety of solutions to this problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                The difficulty is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow for the type of expansion and
                contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell
                (Lissemys punctata), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can
                exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the
                lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can
                suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom
                of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special
                muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down,
                resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction
                with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).[91]
            </p>
            <p>
                Breathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult
                female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their
                breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles
                breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb
                movements.[92] This is because they use their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last
                species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes
                smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating that
                there may be mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. Box turtles
                have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.</p>
            <h3>Skin</h3>
            <p>Reptilian skin is covered in a horny epidermis, making it watertight and enabling reptiles to live on dry
                land, in contrast to amphibians. Compared to mammalian skin, that of reptiles is rather thin and lacks
                the thick dermal layer that produces leather in mammals.[93] Exposed parts of reptiles are protected by
                scales or scutes, sometimes with a bony base, forming armor. In lepidosaurians, such as lizards and
                snakes, the whole skin is covered in overlapping epidermal scales. Such scales were once thought to be
                typical of the class Reptilia as a whole, but are now known to occur only in lepidosaurians.[citation
                needed] The scales found in turtles and crocodiles are of dermal, rather than epidermal, origin and are
                properly termed scutes.[citation needed] In turtles, the body is hidden inside a hard shell composed of
                fused scutes.

                Lacking a thick dermis, reptilian leather is not as strong as mammalian leather. It is used in
                leather-wares for decorative purposes for shoes, belts and handbags, particularly crocodile skin.

                Shedding. Reptiles shed their skin through a process called ecdysis which occurs continuously throughout
                their lifetime. In particular, younger reptiles tend to shed once every 5–6 weeks while adults shed 3–4
                times a year.[94] Younger reptiles shed more because of their rapid growth rate. Once full size, the
                frequency of shedding drastically decreases. The process of ecdysis involves forming a new layer of skin
                under the old one. Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between the old and new layers of
                skin. Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing shedding to occur.[95] Snakes will
                shed from the head to the tail while lizards shed in a "patchy pattern".[95] Dysecdysis, a common skin
                disease in snakes and lizards, will occur when ecdysis, or shedding, fails.[96] There are numerous
                reasons why shedding fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, nutritional
                deficiencies, dehydration and traumatic injuries.[95] Nutritional deficiencies decrease proteolytic
                enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers. Traumatic injuries on
                the other hand, form scars that will not allow new scales to form and disrupt the process of
                ecdysis.[96] </p>
            <h3>Excretion</h3>
            <p>Excretion is performed mainly by two small kidneys. In diapsids, uric acid is the main nitrogenous waste
                product; turtles, like mammals, excrete mainly urea. Unlike the kidneys of mammals and birds, reptile
                kidneys are unable to produce liquid urine more concentrated than their body fluid. This is because they
                lack a specialized structure called a loop of Henle, which is present in the nephrons of birds and
                mammals. Because of this, many reptiles use the colon to aid in the reabsorption of water. Some are also
                able to take up water stored in the bladder. Excess salts are also excreted by nasal and lingual salt
                glands in some reptiles.[97]

                In all reptiles the urinogenital ducts and the anus both empty into an organ called a cloaca. In some
                reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca may open into a urinary bladder, but not all. It is present in
                all turtles and tortoises as well as most lizards, but is lacking in the monitor lizard, the legless
                lizards. It is absent in the snakes, alligators, and crocodiles.[98]

                Many turtles, tortoises, and lizards have proportionally very large bladders. Charles Darwin noted that
                the Galapagos tortoise had a bladder which could store up to 20% of its body weight.[99] Such
                adaptations are the result of environments such as remote islands and deserts where water is very
                scarce.[100]:143 Other desert-dwelling reptiles have large bladders that can store a long-term reservoir
                of water for up to several months and aid in osmoregulation.[101]

                Turtles have two or more accessory urinary bladders, located lateral to the neck of the urinary bladder
                and dorsal to the pubis, occupying a significant portion of their body cavity.[102] Their bladder is
                also usually bilobed with a left and right section. The right section is located under the liver, which
                prevents large stones from remaining in that side while the left section is more likely to have
                calculi.[103] </p>
            <h3>Digestion</h3>
            <p>Most reptiles are insectivorous or carnivorous and have simple and comparatively short digestive tracts
                due to meat being fairly simple to break down and digest. Digestion is slower than in mammals,
                reflecting their lower resting metabolism and their inability to divide and masticate their food.[104]
                Their poikilotherm metabolism has very low energy requirements, allowing large reptiles like crocodiles
                and large constrictors to live from a single large meal for months, digesting it slowly.[80]

                While modern reptiles are predominantly carnivorous, during the early history of reptiles several groups
                produced some herbivorous megafauna: in the Paleozoic, the pareiasaurs; and in the Mesozoic several
                lines of dinosaurs.[45] Today, turtles are the only predominantly herbivorous reptile group, but several
                lines of agamas and iguanas have evolved to live wholly or partly on plants.[105]

                Herbivorous reptiles face the same problems of mastication as herbivorous mammals but, lacking the
                complex teeth of mammals, many species swallow rocks and pebbles (so called gastroliths) to aid in
                digestion: The rocks are washed around in the stomach, helping to grind up plant matter.[105] Fossil
                gastroliths have been found associated with both ornithopods and sauropods, though whether they actually
                functioned as a gastric mill in the latter is disputed.[106][107] Salt water crocodiles also use
                gastroliths as ballast, stabilizing them in the water or helping them to dive.[108] A dual function as
                both stabilizing ballast and digestion aid has been suggested for gastroliths found in plesiosaurs.[109]
            </p>
            <h3>Nerves</h3>
            <p>The reptilian nervous system contains the same basic part of the amphibian brain, but the reptile
                cerebrum and cerebellum are slightly larger. Most typical sense organs are well developed with certain
                exceptions, most notably the snake's lack of external ears (middle and inner ears are present). There
                are twelve pairs of cranial nerves.[110] Due to their short cochlea, reptiles use electrical tuning to
                expand their range of audible frequencies. </p>
            <h4>Intelligence</h4>
            <p>Reptiles are generally considered less intelligent than mammals and birds.[34] The size of their brain
                relative to their body is much less than that of mammals, the encephalization quotient being about one
                tenth of that of mammals,[111] though larger reptiles can show more complex brain development. Larger
                lizards, like the monitors, are known to exhibit complex behavior, including cooperation.[112]
                Crocodiles have relatively larger brains and show a fairly complex social structure. The Komodo dragon
                is even known to engage in play,[113] as are turtles, which are also considered to be social
                creatures,[citation needed] and sometimes switch between monogamy and promiscuity in their sexual
                behavior.[citation needed] One study found that wood turtles were better than white rats at learning to
                navigate mazes.[114] Another study found that giant tortoises are capable of learning through operant
                conditioning, visual discrimination and retained learned behaviors with long-term memory.[115]</p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>Most reptiles are diurnal animals. The vision is typically adapted to daylight conditions, with color
                vision and more advanced visual depth perception than in amphibians and most mammals. In some species,
                such as blind snakes, vision is reduced.
            </p><p>
                Some snakes have extra sets of visual organs (in the loosest sense of the word) in the form of pits
                sensitive to infrared radiation (heat). Such heat-sensitive pits are particularly well developed in the
                pit vipers, but are also found in boas and pythons. These pits allow the snakes to sense the body heat
                of birds and mammals, enabling pit vipers to hunt rodents in the dark</p>
            <h3>Reproduction</h3>
            <p>Reptiles generally reproduce sexually, though some are capable of asexual reproduction. All reproductive
                activity occurs through the cloaca, the single exit/entrance at the base of the tail where waste is also
                eliminated. Most reptiles have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored
                inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis, while squamates,
                including snakes and lizards, possess a pair of hemipenes, only one of which is typically used in each
                session. Tuatara, however, lack copulatory organs, and so the male and female simply press their cloacas
                together as the male discharges sperm.[116]
            </p><p>
                Most reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion, chorion, and
                allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and
                keeps it from drying out, but it is flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange
                between the inside and outside of the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to
                enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and
                protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The
                amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5)
                aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3)
                contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the
                embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching.
                This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of
                development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in
                squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of
                reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before
                hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and
                provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of
                viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs,[117] although some individuals or taxa in that
                clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups
                of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and
                Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.[10]
            </p><p>
                Asexual reproduction has been identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake. In some
                species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the
                mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called parthenogenesis, occurs in several species of gecko,
                and is particularly widespread in the teiids (especially Aspidocelis) and lacertids (Lacerta). In
                captivity, Komodo dragons (Varanidae) have reproduced by parthenogenesis.</p>
<p>
                Parthenogenetic species are suspected to occur among chameleons, agamids, xantusiids, and typhlopids.

               <p> Some reptiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TDSD), in which the incubation
                temperature determines whether a particular egg hatches as male or female. TDSD is most common in
                turtles and crocodiles, but also occurs in lizards and tuatara.[118] To date, there has been no
                confirmation of whether TDSD occurs in snakes.</p>
