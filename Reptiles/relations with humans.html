            <p>Dinosaurs have been widely depicted in culture since the English palaeontologist Richard Owen coined the name
                dinosaur in 1842. As soon as 1854, the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs were on display to the public in south
                London.[136][137] One dinosaur appeared in literature even earlier, as Charles Dickens placed a Megalosaurus
                in the first chapter of his novel Bleak House in 1852.[138] The dinosaurs featured in books, films,
                television programs, artwork, and other media have been used for both education and entertainment. The
                depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries of the 1990s and first decade of the
                21st century, or the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.[137][139][140]

                The snake or serpent has played a powerful symbolic role in different cultures. In Egyptian history, the
                Nile cobra adorned the crown of the pharaoh. It was worshipped as one of the gods and was also used for
                sinister purposes: murder of an adversary and ritual suicide (Cleopatra). In Greek mythology snakes are
                associated with deadly antagonists, as a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as earthbound. The nine-headed
                Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth. Medusa
                was one of the three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated. Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with
                snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to stone with her gaze. After killing her, Perseus gave her
                head to Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis. The Titans are depicted in art with their legs
                replaced by bodies of snakes for the same reason: They are children of Gaia, so they are bound to the
                earth.[141] In Hinduism, snakes are worshipped as gods, with many women pouring milk on snake pits. The
                cobra is seen on the neck of Shiva, while Vishnu is depicted often as sleeping on a seven-headed snake or
                within the coils of a serpent. There are temples in India solely for cobras sometimes called Nagraj (King of
                Snakes), and it is believed that snakes are symbols of fertility. In the annual Hindu festival of Nag
                Panchami, snakes are venerated and prayed to.[142] In religious terms, the snake and jaguar are arguably the
                most important animals in ancient Mesoamerica. "In states of ecstasy, lords dance a serpent dance; great
                descending snakes adorn and support buildings from Chichen Itza to Tenochtitlan, and the Nahuatl word coatl
                meaning serpent or twin, forms part of primary deities such as Mixcoatl, Quetzalcoatl, and Coatlicue."[143]
                In Christianity and Judaism, a serpent appears in Genesis to tempt Adam and Eve with the forbidden fruit
                from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.[144]

                The turtle has a prominent position as a symbol of steadfastness and tranquility in religion, mythology, and
                folklore from around the world.[145] A tortoise's longevity is suggested by its long lifespan and its shell,
                which was thought to protect it from any foe.[146] In the cosmological myths of several cultures a World
                Turtle carries the world upon its back or supports the heavens</p>
            <h3>Medicine</h3>
            <p>Deaths from snakebites are uncommon in many parts of the world, but are still counted in tens of thousands
                per year in India.[148] Snakebite can be treated with antivenom made from the venom of the snake. To produce
                antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of different species of snake is injected into the body of a horse in
                ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted; the serum is separated,
                purified and freeze-dried.[149] The cytotoxic effect of snake venom is being researched as a potential
                treatment for cancers.[150]

                Lizards such as the Gila monster produce toxins with medical applications. Gila toxin reduces plasma
                glucose; the substance is now synthesised for use in the anti-diabetes drug exenatide (Byetta).[151] Another
                toxin from Gila monster saliva has been studied for use as an anti-Alzheimer's drug.[152]

            <p>
                Geckos have also been used as medicine, especially in China.[153] Turtles have been used in Chinese
                traditional medicine for thousands of years, with every part of the turtle believed to have medical
                benefits. There is a lack of scientific evidence that would correlate claimed medical benefits to turtle
                consumption. Growing demand for turtle meat has placed pressure on vulnerable wild populations of turtles</p>
            <h3>Commercial farming</h3>
            <p>Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, and are farmed commercially. Their hides are tanned and
                used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy.[155]
                The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles. Farming has resulted in an increase
                in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so
                landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat. Crocodile leather is made into wallets, briefcases,
                purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes. Crocodile oil has been used for various purposes.[156]
            </p>
            <p>
                Snakes are also farmed, primarily in East and Southeast Asia, and their production has become more intensive
                in the last decade. Snake farming has been troubling for conservation in the past as it can lead to
                overexploitation of wild snakes and their natural prey to supply the farms. However, farming snakes can
                limit the hunting of wild snakes, while reducing the slaughter of higher-order vertebrates like cows. The
                energy efficiency of snakes is higher than expected for carnivores, due to their ectothermy and low
                metabolism. Waste protein from the poultry and pig industries is used as feed in snake farms.[157] Snake
                farms produce meat, snake skin, and antivenom.
            </p>
    <p>            Turtle farming is another known but controversial practice. Turtles have been farmed for a variety of
                reasons, ranging from food to traditional medicine, the pet trade, and scientific conservation. Demand for
                turtle meat and medicinal products is one of the main threats to turtle conservation in Asia. Though
                commercial breeding would seem to insulate wild populations, it can stoke the demand for them and increase
                wild captures.[158][154] Even the potentially appealing concept of raising turtles at a farm to release into
                the wild is questioned by some veterinarians who have had some experience with farm operations. They caution
                that this may introduce into the wild populations infectious diseases that occur on the farm, but have not
                (yet) been occurring in the wild</p>
            <h3>Reptiles in captivity
    
            </h3>
            <p>In the Western world, some snakes (especially docile species such as the ball python and corn snake) are kept
                as pets.[161] Numerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including bearded dragons,[162] iguanas,
                anoles,[163] and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko).[162]
            </p>
            <p>
                Turtles and tortoises are an increasingly popular pet, but keeping them can be challenging due to particular
                requirements, such as temperature control and a varied diet, as well as the long lifespans of turtles, who
                can potentially outlive their owners. Good hygiene and significant maintenance is necessary when keeping
                reptiles, due to the risks of Salmonella and other pathogens.[164]
