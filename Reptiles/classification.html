            <p>
                In the 13th century the category of reptile was recognized in Europe as consisting of a miscellany of
                egg-laying creatures, including "snakes, various fantastic monsters, lizards, assorted amphibians, and
                worms", as recorded by Vincent of Beauvais in his Mirror of Nature.[11] In the 18th century, the reptiles
                were, from the outset of classification, grouped with the amphibians. Linnaeus, working from species-poor
                Sweden, where the common adder and grass snake are often found hunting in water, included all reptiles and
                amphibians in class "III – Amphibia" in his Systema Naturæ.[12] The terms "reptile" and "amphibian" were
                largely interchangeable, "reptile" (from Latin repere, "to creep") being preferred by the French.[13]
                Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti was the first to formally use the term "Reptilia" for an expanded selection of
                reptiles and amphibians basically similar to that of Linnaeus.[14] Today, the two groups are still commonly
                treated under the same heading as herptiles.</p>
            <p>
                It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in
                fact, quite different animals, and Pierre André Latreille erected the class Batracia (1825) for the latter,
                dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.[15] The
                British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley made Latreille's definition popular and, together with Richard Owen,
                expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil "antediluvian monsters", including dinosaurs and the
                mammal-like (synapsid) Dicynodon he helped describe. This was not the only possible classification scheme:
                In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates
                into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and amphibians). He subsequently
                proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter two groups.[16] In 1866, Haeckel
                demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their reproductive strategies, and that reptiles,
                birds, and mammals were united by the amniotic egg.
            </p>
            <p>
                The terms "Sauropsida" ("lizard faces") and "Theropsida" ("beast faces") were used again in 1916 by E.S.
                Goodrich to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on the one hand (Sauropsida) and mammals
                and their extinct relatives (Theropsida) on the other. Goodrich supported this division by the nature of the
                hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other features, such as the structure of the forebrain.
                According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved from an earlier stem group, Protosauria ("first lizards") in
                which he included some animals today considered reptile-like amphibians, as well as early reptiles.[17]
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1956, D.M.S. Watson observed that the first two groups diverged very early in reptilian history, so he
                divided Goodrich's Protosauria between them. He also reinterpreted Sauropsida and Theropsida to exclude
                birds and mammals, respectively. Thus his Sauropsida included Procolophonia, Eosuchia, Millerosauria,
                Chelonia (turtles), Squamata (lizards and snakes), Rhynchocephalia, Crocodilia, "thecodonts" (paraphyletic
                basal Archosauria), non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and sauropterygians.[18]</p>
            <p>
                In the late 19th century, a number of definitions of Reptilia were offered. The traits listed by Lydekker in
                1896, for example, include a single occipital condyle, a jaw joint formed by the quadrate and articular
                bones, and certain characteristics of the vertebrae.[19] The animals singled out by these formulations, the
                amniotes other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.[20]
                The first reptiles had an anapsid type of skull roof, as seen in the Permian genus Captorhinus
            </p>
            The synapsid/sauropsid division supplemented another approach, one that split the reptiles into four
            subclasses based on the number and position of temporal fenestrae, openings in the sides of the skull behind
            the eyes. This classification was initiated by Henry Fairfield Osborn and elaborated and made popular by
            Romer's classic Vertebrate Paleontology.[21][22] Those four subclasses were:
            </p>
            Anapsida – no fenestrae – cotylosaurs and Chelonia (turtles and relatives)[note 1]
            Synapsida – one low fenestra – pelycosaurs and therapsids (the 'mammal-like reptiles')
            Euryapsida – one high fenestra (above the postorbital and squamosal) – protorosaurs (small, early
            lizard-like reptiles) and the marine sauropterygians and ichthyosaurs, the latter called Parapsida in
            Osborn's work.<br>
            Diapsida – two fenestrae – most reptiles, including lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs and pterosaurs
            </p>
            The composition of Euryapsida was uncertain. Ichthyosaurs were, at times, considered to have arisen
            independently of the other euryapsids, and given the older name Parapsida. Parapsida was later discarded as
            a group for the most part (ichthyosaurs being classified as incertae sedis or with Euryapsida). However,
            four (or three if Euryapsida is merged into Diapsida) subclasses remained more or less universal for
            non-specialist work throughout the 20th century. It has largely been abandoned by recent researchers: in
            particular, the anapsid condition has been found to occur so variably among unrelated groups that it is not
            now considered a useful distinction.[23]
            Phylogenetics and modern definition<br>
            Phylogenetic classifications group the traditional "mammal-like reptiles", like this Varanodon, with other
            synapsids, not with extant reptiles
            </p>
    
            By the early 21st century, vertebrate paleontologists were beginning to adopt phylogenetic taxonomy, in
            which all groups are defined in such a way as to be monophyletic; that is, groups include all descendants of
            a particular ancestor. The reptiles as historically defined are paraphyletic, since they exclude both birds
            and mammals. These respectively evolved from dinosaurs and from early therapsids, which were both
            traditionally called reptiles.[24] Birds are more closely related to crocodilians than the latter are to the
            rest of extant reptiles. Colin Tudge wrote:
            </p>
            Mammals are a clade, and therefore the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and
            birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact,
            subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is
            just a section of the clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived
            off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination
            of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At
            best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian
            amniotes'.[20]

            Despite the early proposals for replacing the paraphyletic Reptilia with a monophyletic Sauropsida, which
            includes birds, that term was never adopted widely or, when it was, was not applied consistently.[1] When
            Sauropsida was used, it often had the same content or even the same definition as Reptilia. In 1988, Jacques
            Gauthier proposed a cladistic definition of Reptilia as a monophyletic node-based crown group containing
            turtles, lizards and snakes, crocodilians, and birds, their common ancestor and all its descendants. Because
            the actual relationship of turtles to other reptiles was not yet well understood at this time, Gauthier's
            definition came to be considered inadequate.[1]
            </p>
            A variety of other definitions were proposed by other scientists in the years following Gauthier's paper.
            The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the PhyloCode, was published by
            Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a
            modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it
            stable and monophyletic. They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to Lacerta agilis and Crocodylus
            niloticus than to Homo sapiens. This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more common definition of
            Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is better known and more
            frequently used. Unlike most previous definitions of Reptilia, however, Modesto and Anderson's definition
            includes birds,[1] as they are within the clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.
