        <div id="r2"> <h3>Origin of the reptiles</h3>
            <p>The origin of the reptiles lies about 310–320 million years ago, in the steaming swamps of the late
                Carboniferous period, when the first reptiles evolved from advanced reptiliomorphs.[3]

                The oldest known animal that may have been an amniote is Casineria (though it may have been a
                temnospondyl).[37][38][39] A series of footprints from the fossil strata of Nova Scotia dated to 315 Ma
                show typical reptilian toes and imprints of scales.[40] These tracks are attributed to Hylonomus, the
                oldest unquestionable reptile known.[41] It was a small, lizard-like animal, about 20 to 30 centimetres
                (7.9 to 11.8 in) long, with numerous sharp teeth indicating an insectivorous diet.[42] Other examples
                include Westlothiana (for the moment considered a reptiliomorph rather than a true amniote)[43] and
                Paleothyris, both of similar build and presumably similar habit. </p>
            <h3>Rise of the reptiles</h3>
            <p>The earliest amniotes, including stem-reptiles (those amniotes closer to modern reptiles than to
                mammals), were largely overshadowed by larger stem-tetrapods, such as Cochleosaurus, and remained a
                small, inconspicuous part of the fauna until the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse.[44] This sudden
                collapse affected several large groups. Primitive tetrapods were particularly devastated, while
                stem-reptiles fared better, being ecologically adapted to the drier conditions that followed. Primitive
                tetrapods, like modern amphibians, need to return to water to lay eggs; in contrast, amniotes, like
                modern reptiles – whose eggs possess a shell that allows them to be laid on land – were better adapted
                to the new conditions. Amniotes acquired new niches at a faster rate than before the collapse and at a
                much faster rate than primitive tetrapods. They acquired new feeding strategies including herbivory and
                carnivory, previously only having been insectivores and piscivores.[44] From this point forward,
                reptiles dominated communities and had a greater diversity than primitive tetrapods, setting the stage
                for the Mesozoic (known as the Age of Reptiles).[45] One of the best known early stem-reptiles is
                Mesosaurus, a genus from the Early Permian that had returned to water, feeding on fish. </p>



            <h3>Anapsids, synapsids, diapsids, and sauropsids</h3>
            <p>It was traditionally assumed that the first reptiles retained an anapsid skull inherited from their
                ancestors.[46] This type of skull has a skull roof with only holes for the nostrils, eyes and a pineal
                eye.[34] The discoveries of synapsid-like openings (see below) in the skull roof of the skulls of
                several members of Parareptilia (the clade containing most of the amniotes traditionally referred to as
                "anapsids"), including lanthanosuchoids, millerettids, bolosaurids, some nycteroleterids, some
                procolophonoids and at least some mesosaurs[47][48][49] made it more ambiguous and it's currently
                uncertain whether the ancestral amniote had an anapsid-like or synapsid-like skull.[49] These animals
                are traditionally referred to as "anapsids", and form a paraphyletic basic stock from which other groups
                evolved.[1] Very shortly after the first amniotes appeared, a lineage called Synapsida split off; this
                group was characterized by a temporal opening in the skull behind each eye to give room for the jaw
                muscle to move. These are the "mammal-like amniotes", or stem-mammals, that later gave rise to the true
                mammals.[50] Soon after, another group evolved a similar trait, this time with a double opening behind
                each eye, earning them the name Diapsida ("two arches").[46] The function of the holes in these groups
                was to lighten the skull and give room for the jaw muscles to move, allowing for a more powerful
                bite.</p>
            <p>
                Turtles have been traditionally believed to be surviving parareptiles, on the basis of their anapsid
                skull structure, which was assumed to be primitive trait.[51] The rationale for this classification has
                been disputed, with some arguing that turtles are diapsids that evolved anapsid skulls in order to
                improve their armor.[3] Later morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly
                within Diapsida.[52] All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within
                diapsids, most commonly as a sister group to extant archosaurs</p>


            <h3>Permian reptiles</h3>
            <p>With the close of the Carboniferous, the amniotes became the dominant tetrapod fauna. While primitive,
                terrestrial reptiliomorphs still existed, the synapsid amniotes evolved the first truly terrestrial
                megafauna (giant animals) in the form of pelycosaurs, such as Edaphosaurus and the carnivorous
                Dimetrodon. In the mid-Permian period, the climate became drier, resulting in a change of fauna: The
                pelycosaurs were replaced by the therapsids</p>

            <p>The parareptiles, whose massive skull roofs had no postorbital holes, continued and flourished throughout
                the Permian. The pareiasaurian parareptiles reached giant proportions in the late Permian, eventually
                disappearing at the close of the period (the turtles being possible survivors).[53]
            </p>
            <p>
                Early in the period, the modern reptiles, or crown-group reptiles, evolved and split into two main
                lineages: the Archosauromorpha (forebears of turtles, crocodiles, and dinosaurs) and the
                Lepidosauromorpha (predecessors of modern lizards and tuataras). Both groups remained lizard-like and
                relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian. </p>

            <h3>Mesozoic reptiles</h3>
            <p>The close of the Permian saw the greatest mass extinction known (see the Permian–Triassic extinction
                event), an event prolonged by the combination of two or more distinct extinction pulses.[54] Most of the
                earlier parareptile and synapsid megafauna disappeared, being replaced by the true reptiles,
                particularly archosauromorphs. These were characterized by elongated hind legs and an erect pose, the
                early forms looking somewhat like long-legged crocodiles. The archosaurs became the dominant group
                during the Triassic period, though it took 30 million years before their diversity was as great as the
                animals that lived in the Permian.[54] Archosaurs developed into the well-known dinosaurs and
                pterosaurs, as well as the ancestors of crocodiles. Since reptiles, first rauisuchians and then
                dinosaurs, dominated the Mesozoic era, the interval is popularly known as the "Age of Reptiles". The
                dinosaurs also developed smaller forms, including the feather-bearing smaller theropods. In the
                Cretaceous period, these gave rise to the first true birds.[55]
            </p>
            <p>
                The sister group to Archosauromorpha is Lepidosauromorpha, containing lizards and tuataras, as well as
                their fossil relatives. Lepidosauromorpha contained at least one major group of the Mesozoic sea
                reptiles: the mosasaurs, which lived during the Cretaceous period. The phylogenetic placement of other
                main groups of fossil sea reptiles – the ichthyopterygians (including ichthyosaurs) and the
                sauropterygians, which evolved in the early Triassic – is more controversial. Different authors linked
                these groups either to lepidosauromorphs[56] or to archosauromorphs,[57][58][59] and ichthyopterygians
                were also argued to be diapsids that did not belong to the least inclusive clade containing
                lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs</p>




            <h3>Cenozoic reptiles</h3>
            <p>The close of the Cretaceous period saw the demise of the Mesozoic era reptilian megafauna (see the
                Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Of the large marine reptiles, only sea turtles were left; and of
                the non-marine large reptiles, only the semi-aquatic crocodiles and broadly similar choristoderes
                survived the extinction, with the latter becoming extinct in the Miocene.[62] Of the great host of
                dinosaurs dominating the Mesozoic, only the small beaked birds survived. This dramatic extinction
                pattern at the end of the Mesozoic led into the Cenozoic. Mammals and birds filled the empty niches left
                behind by the reptilian megafauna and, while reptile diversification slowed, bird and mammal
                diversification took an exponential turn.[45] However, reptiles were still important components of the
                megafauna, particularly in the form of large and giant tortoises.[63][64]
            </p>
            <p>
                After the extinction of most archosaur and marine reptile lines by the end of the Cretaceous, reptile
                diversification continued throughout the Cenozoic. Squamates took a massive hit during the KT-event,
                only recovering ten million years after it,[65] but they underwent a great radiation event once they
                recovered, and today squamates make up the majority of living reptiles (> 95%).[66][67] Approximately
                10,000 extant species of traditional reptiles are known, with birds adding about 10,000 more, almost
                twice the number of mammals, represented by about 5,700 living species (excluding domesticated species)
