        <div id="r2">  <p>Many small reptiles, such as snakes and lizards that live on the ground or in the water, are vulnerable
            to being preyed on by all kinds of carnivorous animals. Thus avoidance is the most common form of
            defense in reptiles.[120] At the first sign of danger, most snakes and lizards crawl away into the
            undergrowth, and turtles and crocodiles will plunge into water and sink out of sight. </p>
        <h3>Camouflage and warning</h3>
        <p>Reptiles tend to avoid confrontation through camouflage. Two major groups of reptile predators are birds
            and other reptiles, both of which have well developed color vision. Thus the skins of many reptiles have
            cryptic coloration of plain or mottled gray, green, and brown to allow them to blend into the background
            of their natural environment.[121] Aided by the reptiles' capacity for remaining motionless for long
            periods, the camouflage of many snakes is so effective that people or domestic animals are most
            typically bitten because they accidentally step on them.[122]
        </p>
            When camouflage fails to protect them, blue-tongued skinks will try to ward off attackers by displaying
            their blue tongues, and the frill-necked lizard will display its brightly colored frill. These same
            displays are used in territorial disputes and during courtship.[123] If danger arises so suddenly that
            flight is useless, crocodiles, turtles, some lizards, and some snakes hiss loudly when confronted by an
            enemy. Rattlesnakes rapidly vibrate the tip of the tail, which is composed of a series of nested, hollow
            beads to ward of approaching danger.</p>
            <p>

            In contrast to the normal drab coloration of most reptiles, the lizards of the genus Heloderma (the Gila
            monster and the beaded lizard) and many of the coral snakes have high-contrast warning coloration,
            warning potential predators they are venomous.[124] A number of non-venomous North American snake
            species have colorful markings similar to those of the coral snake, an oft cited example of Batesian
            mimicry.</p>
