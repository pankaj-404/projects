        <div> <h2>About Reptiles</h2>
            <p>amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile
                orders,
                historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.<br>

                Because some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles (e.g.,
                crocodiles
                are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards), the traditional groups of "reptiles" listed
                above do not together constitute a monophyletic grouping or clade (consisting of all descendants of a
                common
                ancestor). For this reason, many modern scientists prefer to consider the birds part of Reptilia as
                well,
                thereby making Reptilia a monophyletic class, including all living Diapsids. The term "reptiles"
                is sometimes used as shorthand for 'non-avian Reptilia'.<br>

                The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous
                period,
                having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods that became increasingly adapted to life on dry
                land.
                Some early examples include the lizard-like Hylonomus and Casineria. In addition to the living reptiles,
                there are many diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In
                particular, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs,
                ornithischians,
                and sauropods, as well as many species of theropods, including troodontids, dromaeosaurids,
                tyrannosaurids,
                and abelisaurids, along with many Crocodyliformes, and squamates (e.g. mosasaurids).<br>

                Modern non-avian reptiles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica, although some birds are found on
                the
                periphery of Antarctica. Several living subgroups are recognized: Testudines (turtles and tortoises),
                350
                species; Rhynchocephalia (tuatara from New Zealand), 1 species;Squamata (lizards, snakes, and worm
                lizards), over 10,200 species;Crocodilia (crocodiles, gharials, caimans, and alligators), 24 species;[7]
                and Aves (birds), approximately 10,000 species.

                Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are descended
                from
                four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles
                are
                oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic
                clades – the fetus develops within the mother, contained in a placenta rather than an eggshell. As
                amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to
                reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of
                placenta analogous to those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant
                reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko, Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to 17 mm (0.7 in)
                to
                the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, which can reach 6 m (19.7 ft) in length and weigh over
                1,000 kg
                (2,200 lb). </p>
